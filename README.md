   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   
   **Explanation of the Command:**
   - `docker-compose`: The Docker Compose command-line tool.
   - `up`: Builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service.
   - `--build`: Forces the rebuilding of the Docker images.

   **What Happens Next:**
   - **Web Service:** Builds the FastAPI application from the current directory and starts the server on port `8000`.
   - **Database Service:** Pulls the PostgreSQL image, sets up the database with the specified credentials, and starts the service on port `5432`.
   - **pgAdmin Service:** Pulls the pgAdmin image and starts the web interface on port `5050`.

4. **Access the FastAPI Application:**
   Once the services are up and running, you can interact with the FastAPI application:
   - **API Documentation:** Navigate to [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) to access the automatically generated Swagger UI documentation.
   - **Root Endpoint:** Access [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to verify that the API is running.

5. **Access pgAdmin:**
   pgAdmin provides a graphical interface to manage your PostgreSQL database:
   - **URL:** [http://localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050)
   - **Login Credentials:**
     - **Email:** `admin@example.com`
     - **Password:** `admin`

6. **Configure pgAdmin to Connect to PostgreSQL:**
   After logging into pgAdmin:
   1. **Add a New Server:**
      - Click on "Add New Server."
   2. **General Tab:**
      - **Name:** `FastAPI PostgreSQL`
   3. **Connection Tab:**
      - **Host:** `db` *(As defined in `docker-compose.yml`)*
      - **Port:** `5432`
      - **Maintenance Database:** `fastapi_db`
      - **Username:** `postgres`
      - **Password:** `postgres`
   4. **Save:** Click "Save" to establish the connection.

   You should now see the `fastapi_db` database in pgAdmin, allowing you to manage tables, run queries, and perform administrative tasks.

7. **Stopping the Services:**
   To stop the running containers, press `CTRL + C` in the terminal where Docker Compose is running, then execute:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```
   This command stops and removes the containers, networks, and volumes defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### **Step 4: Interacting with the Database Using SQL and SQLAlchemy**

#### **4.1 Writing and Optimizing SQL Queries**

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is the standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows you to perform various operations, such as querying data, updating records, and managing database structures.

**Core SQL Operations:**

- **Data Querying:** `SELECT` statements to retrieve data.
- **Data Manipulation:** `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements.
- **Data Definition:** `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP` statements for managing database objects.
- **Data Control:** `GRANT` and `REVOKE` statements for permissions.

**Example SQL Queries:**

- **Creating Tables with Relationships:**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE users (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
      email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
      created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  );

  CREATE TABLE calculations (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      operation VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
      operand_a FLOAT NOT NULL,
      operand_b FLOAT NOT NULL,
      result FLOAT NOT NULL,
      timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
      user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
      FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
  );
  ```

- **Inserting Data:**
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('john_doe', 'john@example.com');

  INSERT INTO calculations (operation, operand_a, operand_b, result, user_id) 
  VALUES ('add', 2, 3, 5, 1);
  ```

- **Querying Data with Relationships:**
  ```sql
  SELECT users.username, calculations.operation, calculations.result
  FROM calculations
  JOIN users ON calculations.user_id = users.id
  WHERE users.username = 'john_doe';
  ```

- **Updating Data:**
  ```sql
  UPDATE calculations 
  SET result = 6 
  WHERE id = 1;
  ```

- **Deleting Data:**
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM calculations 
  WHERE id = 1;
  ```

**Optimizing SQL Queries:**

- **Indexing:** Creating indexes on frequently queried columns (e.g., `username`, `operation`) to speed up data retrieval.
- **Joins:** Efficiently using joins to combine data from multiple tables.
- **Avoiding SELECT *:** Specifying only the necessary columns to reduce data transfer and processing time.
- **Using Prepared Statements:** Enhancing performance and security by reusing query plans.

#### **4.2 Interacting with the Database Using SQLAlchemy**

**SQLAlchemy** is a comprehensive SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. It allows developers to interact with databases using Python classes and objects instead of writing raw SQL queries.

**Key Features:**

- **ORM Capabilities:** Maps Python classes to database tables, enabling object-oriented database interactions.
- **SQL Expression Language:** Facilitates the construction of complex SQL queries programmatically.
- **Database Abstraction:** Supports multiple database backends, making it easier to switch between different RDBMS.
- **Session Management:** Handles transactions and connections efficiently.

**Example Usage:**

- **Defining Models with Relationships:**
  ```python
  # app/models.py

  from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Float, DateTime, ForeignKey
  from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
  from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
  from datetime import datetime

  Base = declarative_base()

  class User(Base):
      __tablename__ = 'users'
      
      id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
      username = Column(String(50), unique=True, nullable=False)
      email = Column(String(100), unique=True, nullable=False)
      created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
      
      calculations = relationship("Calculation", back_populates="owner", cascade="all, delete-orphan")

  class Calculation(Base):
      __tablename__ = 'calculations'
      
      id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
      operation = Column(String(20), nullable=False)
      operand_a = Column(Float, nullable=False)
      operand_b = Column(Float, nullable=False)
      result = Column(Float, nullable=False)
      timestamp = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
      user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('users.id'), nullable=False)
      
      owner = relationship("User", back_populates="calculations")
  ```

- **Creating a Session:**
  ```python
  # app/database.py

  from sqlalchemy import create_engine
  from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

  DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/fastapi_db"

  engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
  SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)
  ```

- **Performing CRUD Operations:**
  ```python
  # app/crud.py

  from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
  from app.models import User, Calculation

  def create_user(db: Session, username: str, email: str):
      db_user = User(username=username, email=email)
      db.add(db_user)
      db.commit()
      db.refresh(db_user)
      return db_user

  def get_user(db: Session, user_id: int):
      return db.query(User).filter(User.id == user_id).first()

  def create_calculation(db: Session, operation: str, operand_a: float, operand_b: float, result: float, user_id: int):
      db_calculation = Calculation(
          operation=operation,
          operand_a=operand_a,
          operand_b=operand_b,
          result=result,
          user_id=user_id
      )
      db.add(db_calculation)
      db.commit()
      db.refresh(db_calculation)
      return db_calculation

  def get_calculations_by_user(db: Session, user_id: int):
      return db.query(Calculation).filter(Calculation.user_id == user_id).all()
  ```

**Benefits of Using SQLAlchemy:**

- **Productivity:** Simplifies database interactions, reducing the need to write repetitive SQL code.
- **Maintainability:** Enhances code readability and maintainability through abstraction.
- **Flexibility:** Offers both high-level ORM and low-level SQL expression capabilities, allowing developers to choose the appropriate level of abstraction.

   import logging

   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
   ```

2. **Add Logging Statements:**
   
   ```python
   from app.database import SessionLocal
   from app.crud import create_calculation

   @app.post("/add", response_model=OperationResponse, responses={400: {"model": ErrorResponse}})
   async def add_route(operation: OperationRequest):
       """
       Add two numbers.
       """
       try:
           result = add(operation.a, operation.b)
           logger.info(f"Adding {operation.a} and {operation.b} with result {result}")
           
           # Assume user_id is obtained from authentication (to be implemented in future module)
           user_id = 1  # Placeholder for demonstration
           
           # Store calculation in the database
           db = SessionLocal()
           calculation = create_calculation(db, 'add', operation.a, operation.b, result, user_id)
           db.close()
           
           return OperationResponse(result=result)
       except Exception as e:
           logger.error(f"Add Operation Error: {str(e)}")
           raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))
   ```

3. **Verify Logs:**
   - Run the application and perform operations via the API or frontend to observe logs in the console.
   - Ensure logs provide useful information about operations and any potential errors.

4. **Advanced Logging with Log Levels:**
   - Utilize different log levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`) to categorize log messages appropriately.
   
   ```python
   logger.debug("This is a debug message")
   logger.info("This is an info message")
   logger.warning("This is a warning message")
   logger.error("This is an error message")

## **Hands-On Assignment**

**Title:** Build and Manage Databases in Your Web Application  
**Grading Type:** Points  

**Assignment Instructions:**  

1. **Set Up the Project:**
   - Use the provided code for the **FastAPI Calculator** application.
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed and the application runs locally using Docker Compose.

2. **Implement SQLAlchemy:**
   - Define SQLAlchemy models to represent `User` and `Calculation`.
   - Update `main.py` to interact with the PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy.
   - Establish a one-to-many relationship between `User` and `Calculation`.
   - Ensure that each arithmetic operation (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`) stores the calculation details in the `calculations` table associated with a user.

3. **Create a Database Seeder with Faker:**
   - Install the **Faker** library:
     ```bash
     pip install faker
     ```
   - Create a Python script named `seed_db.py` that uses Faker to generate and insert a significant number of users and their corresponding calculation records into the database.
   - Example `seed_db.py`:
     ```python
     # seed_db.py

     from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
     from app.models import Base, User, Calculation
     from app.database import engine, SessionLocal
     from faker import Faker
     import random

     def seed_database(db: Session, num_users: int = 50, calculations_per_user: int = 20):
         fake = Faker()
         operations = ['add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide']
         for _ in range(num_users):
             username = fake.unique.user_name()
             email = fake.unique.email()
             user = User(username=username, email=email)
             db.add(user)
             db.commit()
             db.refresh(user)
             
             for _ in range(calculations_per_user):
                 operation = random.choice(operations)
                 a = round(random.uniform(1, 100), 2)
                 b = round(random.uniform(1, 100), 2)
                 if operation == 'add':
                     result = a + b
                 elif operation == 'subtract':
                     result = a - b
                 elif operation == 'multiply':
                     result = a * b
                 elif operation == 'divide':
                     result = a / b if b != 0 else 0
                 calculation = Calculation(
                     operation=operation,
                     operand_a=a,
                     operand_b=b,
                     result=result,
                     user_id=user.id
                 )
                 db.add(calculation)
         db.commit()
         print(f"Seeded {num_users} users and {num_users * calculations_per_user} calculations.")

     if __name__ == "__main__":
         Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
         db = SessionLocal()
         seed_database(db, num_users=50, calculations_per_user=20)
         db.close()
     ```
   - Ensure that running `python seed_db.py` populates the `users` and `calculations` tables with realistic data.

4. **Enhance Logging:**
   - Implement logging throughout the application to track database operations and any potential errors.
   - Ensure that logs provide meaningful insights into the application's behavior.

5. **Implement Best Practices for Database Design:**
   - Apply normalization techniques to your database schema.
   - Create appropriate indexes to optimize query performance (e.g., indexing `username` in `users` and `operation` in `calculations`).
   - Ensure data integrity through the use of constraints and relationships.

6. **Utilize Git for Version Control:**
   - Commit changes regularly with descriptive messages.
   - Use branches if working on different features or database optimizations.

7. **Set Up Continuous Integration:**
   - Ensure that GitHub Actions is configured to run your tests automatically on each push.
   - Verify that the CI workflow includes all types of tests and passes successfully.

8. **Write Tests:**
   - **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions and methods in your application.
   - **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between FastAPI routes and the database.
   - **End-to-End Tests:** Simulate user interactions with the web interface and verify the end-to-end functionality.
